# TitanicMLProject
Developed a predictive model to determine passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Kaggle dataset.
Utilized data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to optimize the input dataset.
Implemented and fine-tuned multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to improve prediction accuracy.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the model's performance.
Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance.
Gained hands-on experience with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
