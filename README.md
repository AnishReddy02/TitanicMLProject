# TitanicMLProject

This project involves the development of a predictive model to determine passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous **Kaggle dataset**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an effective machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger would survive based on features such as class, age, sex, and fare.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled **missing values** effectively to ensure clean input data.
- Encoded **categorical features** (e.g., Sex, Embarked) for model compatibility.
- Scaled **numerical features** (e.g., Age, Fare) to improve model performance.

## Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Model Optimization
- Conducted **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV` to enhance performance.
- Fine-tuned models to maximize **prediction accuracy**.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the models using the following metrics:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation.
  - `Scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.
  - `Matplotlib` for data visualization.
